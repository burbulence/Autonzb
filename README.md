# NSA-Autonzb
This script will download and install SABNzbd, Couchpotato, SickRage, Headphones, and Mylar to your Zyxel NAS. It was written to work with FFP on an NSA325, but it has been confirmed to work on other NAS drives. ie 310, 320 (with some extra mods).

Please see the forum thread for the script at http://forum.nas-central.org/viewtopic.php?f=249&t=10881 for more info
