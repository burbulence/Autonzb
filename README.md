# NSA-Autonzb
This script will download and install SABNzbd, Couchpotato, SickRage, Headphones, and Mylar to your Zyxel NAS. It has been written to work with Entware-ng on an NSA325. This package will install all required packages, and with minimal user input start up each service during boot of the nas or whenever the script in ran. 

Please see the forum thread for the script at http://forum.nas-central.org/viewtopic.php?f=249&t=10881 for more info

This is still a work in progress and V0.1 is an initial port from my previous script which was based an the same Nas running FFP.
